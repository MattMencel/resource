- SSL support (@sawanoboly)

# 2.2 (6/18/2014)

- allow port ranges to be passed in as enumerables, which will be tried in sequence until one works: `ChefZero::Server.new(:port => 80.upto(100))`

# 2.1.5 (6/2/2014)

- fix issue with :single_org => <value> not being honored

# 2.1.4 (5/27/2014)

- fix issue with global Thread.exit_on_exception being set

# 2.1.3 (5/27/2014)

- rspec: when chef_zero_opts is set, check if current server has those options before continuing

# 2.1.2 (5/27/2014)

- fix build_uri (and thus cookbook downloads)

# 2.1.1 (5/26/2014)

# 2.1 (5/26/2014)

- **Multi-tenancy!**  If you set :single_org => nil when starting the server, you will gain /organizations/* at the beginning of all URLs.  Internally, all endpoints are rooted at /organizations/ORG anyway, there is just a translation that goes on to add /organizations/single_org to the URL when someone hits chef-zero.
